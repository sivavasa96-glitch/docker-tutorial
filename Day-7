Docker file
============
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions used by Docker to automatically build a Docker image.

Why Dockerfile is user
===≈==================

Dockerfile is used to:
Automate the creation of Docker images
Ensure consistent application environment across development, testing, and production
Make deployment portable and repeatable
Reduce manual installation and configuration steps
Support CI/CD pipelines by building standardized image

Example Dockerfile (Node.js)
=======≈=======≈===

FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

Brief Explanations
==================

FROM: Defines the base image
WORKDIR: Sets the working directory inside the container
COPY: Copies application files into the image
RUN: Executes commands during image build (example: install dependencies)
EXPOSE: Specifies the port used by the application
CMD: Defines the command to run when the container start

Conclusions
=============

A Dockerfile provides a standardized, automated, and version-controlled way to package applications and their dependencies into Docker images for reliable execution in any environment.
